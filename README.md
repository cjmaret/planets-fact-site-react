Project Name: Planets Fact Site

Project Description / Functionality: This site is a planets-factoid site on which users can learn basic information about the 8 planets of the Solar System (should be nine...). Clicking each button will provide info about the planet's three states (overview, internal structure, geology), as well as showing a different view of the cartoon planet. 

Project Technologies/Techniques: React, mapping over a database to render each planet view / information.
