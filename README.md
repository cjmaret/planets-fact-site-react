#Planets Fact Site

Project Name: "Planets Fact Site"

Description:
    Functionality:
        This site displays an interactive infographic about each of the eight planets (not Pluto). The user can click on each of the three information buttons (Overview, Internal Structure, Surface Geology), which displays three different views of each planet, as well as three paragraphs giving brief detail about the planet's structures.
    Technologies:
        This project was built using React, with the planet data being passed through a main component, and unique details (like individual planet colors) in effect through the use of React hooks.
